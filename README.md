To developers: This repo can be directly ran from the source without downloading the .exe binary in the release. Please refer to the following instruction:

Gmod / SFM Steam Workshop Addon: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3738916298
L4D2 Steam Addon: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3748993892

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11, 64-bit (for running from source on Linux, see "Run on Linux" below).
- Python 3.12, 64-bit.
- PowerShell.
- Garry's Mod, L4D2 or SFM installed through Steam for final StudioMDL/gmad compile and
  package steps.

The app manages its own portable Blender 4.5 setup under:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\MMDCharacterImporter
```

VTFCmd and the older VC runtime DLLs needed by VTFCmd/PyOpenGL are included in
`external_tools`.

## One-Time Source Setup

Open a terminal in this repo folder. If your prompt looks like `C:\path>`, you
are using Command Prompt. If it starts with `PS`, you are using PowerShell.

Create the virtual environment first, then activate it as a separate command.
Do not append the activation script path to `python -m venv`.

Command Prompt:

```cmd
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If PowerShell blocks activation, run this once in that same PowerShell window:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If your prompt shows both `(.venv)` and `(base)`, deactivate conda before
building to avoid conda/venv detection warnings:

```powershell
conda deactivate
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Install runtime/build dependencies after activation:

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements-build.txt
```

Download and verify the excluded heavyweight asset:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\download_build_assets.ps1
```

This writes `blender-4.5.10-windows-x64.zip` at repo root. The file is ignored
by git because it is larger than GitHub's normal file-size limit.

To verify an already downloaded asset without downloading again:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\download_build_assets.ps1 -VerifyOnly
```

## Run Without Building

After the one-time source setup, launch the GUI directly from Python:

```powershell
python .\tools\mmd_character_importer_gui.py
```

Optional: verify Blender/add-on setup before launching the GUI:

```powershell
python .\tools\mmd_character_importer_core.py setup
```

The main screen can auto-detect Garry's Mod in common Steam locations. If it
does not, browse to the Garry's Mod install folder or to:

```text
...\GarrysMod\bin\studiomdl.exe
```

## Source to MMD (experimental, Windows)

The **Source → MMD** tab converts an extracted Source character `.mdl` into an
MMD `.pmx` model. It is available beside the main import tab regardless of the
forward workflow's target game. Start with a GMod / Half-Life 2 character with
its `.vvd`, `.vtx`, and material files present.

Choose the model, materials folder, and output folder; click **Analyze model**,
review the character parts, and click **Convert to MMD**. Each run keeps its
logs, reports, textures, and Blender checkpoints. An optional VMD check reimports
the PMX into Blender and samples the motion for severe geometry failures.

This is an initial conversion workflow: automatic secondary physics and moving
iris gaze are not implemented, facial expression combinations are approximate,
and native MMD playback still needs validation. See the
[Source to MMD guide](docs/SourceToMMD.md) for setup, outputs, motion testing, and
the current limits.

## Run on Linux

There is no Linux binary release; on Linux you run the program from source.
Clone the repo and run the launch script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SheepyLord/Gmod-Simple-Character-Model-Importer.git
cd Gmod-Simple-Character-Model-Importer
bash run_linux.sh
```

The script creates a `.venv` virtual environment, installs the runtime
dependencies from `requirements.txt`, and starts the GUI. It also checks for
Wine/Proton (used by the final compile/packaging steps, see the limitations
below) and prints install instructions when neither is found. On first run the
app downloads the official Blender 4.5.10 Linux build (~360 MB) from
blender.org and manages it under:

```text
~/.MMDCharacterImporter
```

Requirements: a 64-bit distro with Python 3.11+ (3.12 recommended,
Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install python3 python3-venv`) and the Qt 6 system
libraries (Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install libxcb-cursor0 libxkbcommon-x11-0
libegl1 libgl1`).

Known limitations on Linux:

- The Blender-side steps (import through proportion export) run natively.
- StudioMDL, gmad and VTFCmd are Windows programs, and the Linux builds of
  Garry's Mod / L4D2 do not ship StudioMDL. With Wine installed the app runs
  those tools automatically (launching them through `wine` and translating
  their path arguments to Wine's `Z:` drive). Install the game's WINDOWS build
  through Steam (force it via Proton compatibility) so `bin/studiomdl.exe`
  exists; the app auto-detects Steam installs under `~/.steam`,
  `~/.local/share/Steam` and flatpak Steam, and the `STUDIOMDL` environment
  variable still overrides the location manually.
- Running the Windows .exe release under Wine is not supported; use
  `run_linux.sh` instead.

## Build The Program

Build the default one-file executable:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\build_mmd_character_importer_exe.ps1 -Python .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe
```

The output is written to `release\GmodSimpleMMDCharacterImporter.exe`.

Build a portable folder instead:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\build_mmd_character_importer_exe.ps1 -Python .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -OneDir
```

Portable output:

```text
release\GmodSimpleMMDCharacterImporter_portable\GmodSimpleMMDCharacterImporter.exe
release\GmodSimpleMMDCharacterImporter_portable\_internal
release\GmodSimpleMMDCharacterImporter_portable\dependency_manifest.json
release\GmodSimpleMMDCharacterImporter_portable\RUN_ME.txt
```

Useful build options:

```powershell
# Change executable name
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\build_mmd_character_importer_exe.ps1 -Python .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -Name MyImporter

# Keep console window for debugging
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\build_mmd_character_importer_exe.ps1 -Python .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -Console

# Use UPX if installed
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\build_mmd_character_importer_exe.ps1 -Python .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -UseUPX
```

## Run A Built Release

After building, launch:

```powershell
.\release\GmodSimpleMMDCharacterImporter.exe
```

For a portable-folder build, keep `_internal` beside the executable and launch:

```powershell
.\release\GmodSimpleMMDCharacterImporter_portable\GmodSimpleMMDCharacterImporter.exe
```
